# Rust CLI RPG Game

## What is this game?

This is personal project intended to practice the basics of Rust and create a nice little terminal based game.



### Game Design

The game consists of a player fighting bosses and upgradint its gear. Killing the final boss will finish the game.

Player has a struct with total hp, damage, critical hit change, weapons, defense, etc.

By killing bosses, the player will make money, with money he/she can buy better gear and continue.
